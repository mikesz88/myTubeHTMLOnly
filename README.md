# [Project 1 - MyTube **HTML Only**](https://mikesz88.github.io/myTubeHTMLOnly/)
Create my own "YouTube" Channel Website called **MyTube**.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Requirements: 
1. This project will need to be built using a code editor of your choice.
   
2. You will pick your own genre of video collections for this website. This could be a "MyTube" about cats, cars, etc. -  about anything. You will give all of the collections and titles and descriptions content within that theme.
   
3. For the videos, just embed YouTube videos.
   
4. The layout does not need to match the mockup. This is to be done with **HTML ONLY**. _CSS will be added in the next project._
   
5. Use HTML tables for basic layout if you wish.
   
6. Your website will have 4 different page "types"
   1. **Home** - this will show 3 "featured" videos (1 from each collection) - Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed _full screen_.
   2. **Collection** pages -  this will be a collection type of your choice (i.e. Cars).** You will have 3** collections/categories. Each page will have **6 videos** that relate to the collection/category - Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.
   3. **Selected Video Page** - when a user clicks on a video title, they will be taken to a page that displays the video along with its title and a short paragraph about the video. - Videos on this page **WILL** be allowed _full screen_.
   4. **Video Upload page** - this will include a form that mimics the ability to upload videos to your channel. The input's and label's should include **ALL required attributes** as if it were a working form.

7. The top navbar will have 5 links - each linking to the respective "collection page".

8. Videos on the "Featured" and "Collection" pages should include a title beneath it.

9. A user should be able to click on the title beneath the video from the Featured or Collection pages and and be navigated to the "selected video page".
